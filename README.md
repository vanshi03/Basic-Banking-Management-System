# Basic-Banking-Management-System
## I created a Simple Dynamic Website on Banking Management System
<ul>
  <li>Created a Dummy Data in PHPMyAdmin using SQL language<br> Added customer field like Name, Email , Contact Information etc.
  </li>
  <li>The flow of the website is as follows:<br>
      Home -> View Customers -> Select a Customer -> Add Amount / Withdraw Amount / Transfer Amount -> See Transaction History -> Contact Information.
  </li>
</ul>

##Here's the link to my site:

 *NOTE: View customer tab and Transaction History tab will not show in the website instead they will get downloaded as the database is made in PHPMyAdmin*
 So Hereby attaching Screenshots of the website!!
